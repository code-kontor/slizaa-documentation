== Gettings Started ==
These instructions should help you get Slizaa up and running in 5 to 15 minutes.

=== Prerequisites
Slizaa requires a Java SE 8 (or greater) environment to run. Refer to the following URL for details
on how to download and install Java SE 8 or greater: http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/.

* Open a Web browser and access the following URL: https://www.codekontor.io/slizaa/download/
* Download the binary distribution that matches your system (zip for windows, tar.gz for unixes)
* Extract the archive to a new folder on your hard drive (in this documentation we will reference this directory as `<SLIZAA_HOME>`)

=== Start the Server
Open a command line console and change the directory to `<SLIZAA_HOME>`.

To start the server, run the following command:

[subs="attributes"]
----
java -jar slizaa-web-{slizaaVersion}.jar
----

You should see the following information on the command line console:

=== Create a Structure Database

Before you can parse and analyze a software application, you have to create a instance of a structure database.
A structure database is the place, where Slizaa stores the 'core' dependency information of a
parsed software system. It is basically a graph database that can be accessed via the BOLT protocol.

==== List all Structure Databases

To list all defined structure databases of a given Slizaa instance, execute the following command:

include::{generatedDocDir}/gettingstarted-listdbs.adoc[]

==== Creating a new Structure Database

To create a new structure database instance, you can use the `createDB` command. You must provide a unique database
name as the first parameter.

include::{generatedDocDir}/gettingstarted-createdb.adoc[]

==== Defining your Application Content

Once you have created a new structure database, you must specify the content that should be analyzed. Slizaa provides
multiple _content definition providers_ to provide a convenient way to specify with JARs and/or folders belong to your
application (see <<ContenDefinitionProviders,Content Definition Providers>> for more information).

In this tutorial we use the `directory` content definition provider type to specify a folder on the local drive that
contains JAR files taht should be parsed. Make sure that

* the specified folder exists and
* the specified folder contains on or more JAR files.

CAUTION: If you using this command on Windows in a ordinary windows shell, make sure that you escape the Backslashes
that act as file separators (e.g. type `C:\\temp\\sl` instead of `C:\temp\sl`).

include::{generatedDocDir}/gettingstarted-setcontentdefinitionprovider.adoc[]

==== Parse the Specified Content

To parse the specified content and to populate the associated database with dependency structure information,
use the following command:

include::{generatedDocDir}/gettingstarted-parsedb.adoc[]

=== Create a hierarchical graph

Once you have populated the internal graph database, you can create a hierarchical view of parsed software system by
using the `createHIerrachicalGraph` command as shown below.

include::{generatedDocDir}/gettingstarted-createhierarchicalgraph.adoc[]

=== The Dependencies View

To inspect and analyze the parsed software system,

* open a Web browser and access the following URL: https://localhost:8085/slizaa. The Slizaa web application
automatically opens the _Dependencies View_.

Select the desired database in the database selector in the upper right corner, as well as the desired hierarchical
graph.

==== The Hierarchical Graph

The Dependencies View visualizes the hierarchical representation of the parsed system in upper left corner (_Hierarchical
Graph_). You can find further information on the Hierarchical Graph view <<dependencies-view-hierarchical-graph, here>>.

==== Dependencies Overview

The _Dependencies Overview_ visualizes the dependencies between the children of the selected element in a Dependency
Structure Matrix. You can select an arbitrary node in the hierarchical graph to inspect the dependencies of its children
in the Dependencies Overview. You can find further information on the Dependencies Overview
<<dependencies-view-hierarchical-graph, here>>.

==== Dependencies Details

You can inspect details of dependencies in the _Dependencies Details_ view in the lower part of the window. To do so,
select a cell in the Dependency Structure Matrix by clicking on it. You can find further information on inspecting
Dependencies Details <<dependencies-view-dependencies-details, here>>.
