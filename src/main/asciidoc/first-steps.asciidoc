These instructions should help you get Slizaa up and running in 5 to 15 minutes.

=== Prerequisites
Slizaa requires a Java SE 8 (or greater) environment to run. Refer to the following URL for details
on how to download and install Java SE 8 or greater: http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/

=== Download and Installation

* Open a Web browser and access the following URL: https://www.codekontor.io/slizaa/download/
* Download the binary distribution that matches your system (zip for windows, tar.gz for unixes)
* Extract the archive to a new folder on your hard drive (in this documentation we will reference this directory as `<SLIZAA_HOME>`)

=== Start the Server
Open a command line console and change the directory to `<SLIZAA_HOME>`.

To start the server, run the following command:

----
java -jar slizaa-web-1.0.0.M3.jar
----

You should see the following information on the command line console:

----
         ___

  / ___/ / /_  / / __ `/ __ `/
 (__  ) / / / /_/ /_/ / /_/ /

=== Create a Structure Database

Before you can parse and analyze a software application, you have to create a instance of a structure database.
A structure database is the place, where Slizaa stores the 'core' dependency information of a
parsed software system. It is basically a graph database that can be accessed via the BOLT protocol.

==== List all Structure Databases

To list all defined structure databases of a given Slizaa instance, execute the following command:

include::{generatedDocDir}/gettingstarted-listdbs.adoc[]

==== Creating a new Structure Database

To create a new structure database instance, you can use the `createDB` command.

include::{generatedDocDir}/gettingstarted-createdb.adoc[]

==== Defining your Application Content

Once you have created a new structure database, you must specify the content that should be analyzed.
In Slizaa {slizaaVersion} there are two different content definition provider you can chosse of:

* *directory*: Using the `directory` content definition provider you can specify an arbitrary folder on
your local drive that contains the JAR files that Slizaa should parse.
* *mvn*: Using the `mvn` content definition provider you can specify a list of maven artifact that
Slizaa should parse. Slizaa automatically will download the specified artifacts during the parsing process.

In this tutorial we use the `directory` content definition provider type to specify a folder on the local drive.
Make sure that

* the specified folder exists and
* the specified folder contains on or more JAR files.

include::{generatedDocDir}/gettingstarted-setcontentdefinitionprovider.adoc[]

==== Parse the Specified Content

To parse the specified content and to populate the associated database with dependency structure information,
use the following command:

include::{generatedDocDir}/gettingstarted-parsedb.adoc[]

=== Create a hierarchical graph
