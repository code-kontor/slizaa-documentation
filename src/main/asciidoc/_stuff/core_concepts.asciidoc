== Software as a Graph

Slizaa is centered around the concept of <<What is a Software Structure Graph?,Software Structure Graphs>>
and internally uses <<What is Neo4j?, Neo4j>> to store the structural information of a software application.

Slizaa allows you to parse arbitrary java-based applications and store there structural information as a
Software Structure Graph in an embedded Neo4j database. In addition

The Software Structures Graphs stored in Neo4j to arbitrary
<<Flat graphs vs. hierarchical graphs, hierarchical graphs>> that can be interactively inspected,
analyzed and visualized using specialized, 'hierarchical-graph-aware' tools.
Using the <<What is the Cypher Query Language?, Cypher Query Language>> you can defined
your own custom queries and visualize the results in Slizza's hierrachical graphs (_[Not implemented in Slizaa {slizaaVersion}]_).
